    It consists of a set of open source software applications that allow the creation of several types of multimedia educational activities: puzzles, association games, text activities, crosswords, wordsearch games and more.
    Besides, the <a href="http://clic.xtec.cat/db/listact_ca.jsp" target="_blank">ClicZone</a> offers a repository where more than a thousand activities are displayed.
    It has been created by teachers and other professionals who want to share their work with others.
